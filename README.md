# WEEK-8-PROJECT---COVID19-GLOBAL-TRACKER 

# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 using real-world data. It explores trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries and time periods using Python. The notebook provides visualizations and key insights from the data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries or regions
- Visualize trends using various types of charts and maps
- Communicate findings through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used

- `pandas` â€“ for data loading, cleaning, and analysis
- `matplotlib` â€“ for data visualization
- `seaborn` â€“ for enhanced plotting and styling
- `plotly` *(optional)* â€“ for interactive visualizations and maps
- `Jupyter Notebook` â€“ to build and present the report
- `VS Code` *(optional)* â€“ as an alternative editor for working on the notebook

## ðŸš€ How to Run/View the Project

1. **Clone or download this repository** to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

   Key Insights & Reflections
Countries like the USA, India, and Brazil reported the highest total cases.

Vaccination rates varied significantly â€” some countries achieved high coverage quickly, while others lagged behind.

The death rate compared to total cases revealed notable differences in healthcare response and capacity.

The timeline analysis shows clear waves of infection across different regions and periods.

Data limitations and reporting inconsistencies are common, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation. 

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using real-world datasets.
